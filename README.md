# SARAH-CODE Learning Journal

This repository is the documentation of my 12-month learning journey in a program i made myself called SARAH-CODE, to become a Data Analyst. Here, i am going to post summaries, personal notes, and code snipplets.

The core concept of this repository is to track my progress and show my learning consistency. 

**To see my finished and polished portfolio projects, please visit pinned repositories in my GitHub main profile.**
