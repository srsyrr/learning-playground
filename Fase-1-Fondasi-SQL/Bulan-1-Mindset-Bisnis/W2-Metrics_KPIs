F1M1W3: Metrics & KPIs

Objective:
To learn how to translate a high-level business strategy into a clear, measurable set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

1. Learned foundational concepts: 
- Metrics vs. KPIs
- Vanity vs. Actionable
- Leading vs. Lagging indicators.

2. Applied strategic frameworks like OKR and SMART to structure goals and ensure clarity.

3. Used the "Analyst as a Doctor" mental model to diagnose a business case study.

Key Formulas
The "code" for this conceptual module was the logic behind key business metrics:
CAC = Total_Spend / New_Customers
CLTV = Avg_Purchase_Value * Avg_Purchase_Frequency * Avg_Customer_Lifespan
Repeat_Rate = (Returning_Customers / Total_Customers) * 100

Case Study Outcome
The project resulted in a KPI strategy for a brand's expansion into a new market.

Objective: Build a profitable and sustainable business.

KPIs Developed:
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) < 80 SAR.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) > 150 SAR within 90 days.
Repeat Purchase Rate of 25% within 60 days.

Key Insight: Long-term profitability depends on the CLTV:CAC ratio, and Repeat Purchase Rate is the main lever to increase CLTV.
