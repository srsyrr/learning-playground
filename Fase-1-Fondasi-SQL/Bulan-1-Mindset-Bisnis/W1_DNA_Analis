My Weekly Learning Summary (F1M1W1)

1. Technical Progress
- Investigative Tools: 
Learned and applied the "Five Whys" technique for effective Root Cause Analysis to dig deeper than surface-level problems.

- Hypothesis & Analysis Planning: 
Practiced how to formulate a measurable hypothesis and, more importantly, how to create a specific analysis plan to validate or reject it with data.

- Practical Application: 
Applied these skills to two different case studies: an e-commerce business with declining sales and a subscription media company with a drop in new subscribers.

2. Business/Analyst Thinking

- Mindset Transformation: 
Mastered the crucial mindset shift from a passive "Translator" (who just fulfills data orders) to a proactive "Detective" (who investigates the "why" behind every request).

- Business Acumen Frameworks: 
Acquired foundational models to understand how a business works, including the "Three Pillars" (Value Proposition, Value Creation, Value Capture) and the "Metrics Pyramid."

- Strategy for Ambiguity: 
Developed a playbook for handling abstract business questions (like "Will this feature be successful?"). The key insight is that an analyst's role is not to predict the future, but to use data to reduce uncertainty.

3. Emotional Journey

Honestly, it was a challenging week. At first, I felt some impostor syndrome, especially when we discussed giving recommendations. I thought, "How can I advise a business expert when I'm just an analyst?" I also felt a bit overwhelmed by how much there is to learn in the data world. But my main breakthrough was realizing that my role isn't to have all the business answers, but to use data to ask the right questions and reduce uncertainty. Now, I feel much more empowered and purposeful. I understand that being a great analyst is a journey of continuous learning, and I'm excited for what's next.
